Then comparison could be done against CHARSXP pointer.
And in this case, you could even avoid the hash call and simply
use the CHARSXP pointer address (or a simple xor hash based on it to
get to 32bit)
** TODO Add collision handling
** TODO Make hash function pluggable
One idea is to test using the CHARSXP's address as hash code.

CHARSXP for key is stored in the epdb.  This adds storage overhead to
list nodes, but avoids having to copy the key data.
